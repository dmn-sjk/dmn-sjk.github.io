    <!-- My research interests lie in deep learning, computer vision, and robotics. 
    Presently, my research revolves around test-time adaptation, and machine perception. 

    My goal is to develop more intelligent and robust perception systems, 
    which can acquire new knowledge and advance the field of lifelong learning in robotics. -->

    My current research focuses on deep learning, machine perception, and robotics, with an emphasis on test-time adaptation.

    I aim to create intelligent, robust perception systems that continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge, 
    possibly advancing lifelong learning in robotics.
    In general, I am interested in all things related to machine learning and robotics.
