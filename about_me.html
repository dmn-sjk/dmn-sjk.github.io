<!-- <h2>Research Topics</h2> -->
<p>
    Presently, my research revolves around test-time adaptation, online continual learning, self-supervised learning, and machine perception. During my master's studies, I conducted research on student race car's perception utilizing LiDAR sensors and investigated the localization of walking robots using haptic signals.
